# SmugMugGalleryCollector

Parses local folder structure to see which images are contained in which folders, then replicates this on SmugMug by finding these images in existing SmugMug galleries then collecting them into new galleries with the same name as the local folder.
This essentially replicates Google Photos galleries, provided that they've been downloaded locally, and that all the images found in those galleries have already been uploaded to SmugMug into some generic galleries (such as for each year).
